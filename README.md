# Social-Feed-Fetcher
Fetches instagram feed using private_instagram_api which can be found here:https://github.com/ping/instagram_private_api

Also, included as part of the codes requirements.txt. 

To install do: pip install -r requirements.txt (be sure to be in right directory).

It will also be nice to get a json chrome extension like jsonview. It will display things nicely.

Also, don't forget to add "/instagram_feeds"(i.e.same pattern for other social accounts) when opening the sever port url
